    "I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many doctors are using TeleHealth and conducting visits via zoom. Before COVID-19, patients would likely fill out a symptom questionnaire/screening in the waiting room of their doctor's office. I decided to make a chat bot in which patients can use to answer questions regarding their symptoms while waiting in the virtual waiting room for the doctor to speak with them next. This questionnaire / symptom screening is designed for someone who is experiencing gastrointestinal concerns and is waiting to speak to a Gastrointestinal Doctor about it. I designed the questions based off of the questions I was asked countless amounts of times at each doctor's or emergency room visit. "
